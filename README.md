# myNN

This is a simple example of Neural Networks and Deep Learning program in C++ using Visual Studio; I recommend to use "Release Mode" as build mode and "MultiByte Character" as character sets.

The activation function is Logistic-Sigmoid function and the network uses Backpropagation.

I used SpamAssasin Corpus as Training and Test data.

This program addresses binary classification.

The number of features is 409 and class values represent 1 (spam) and 0 (non-spam).

Please send me any questions or comments to @pizpizpie
